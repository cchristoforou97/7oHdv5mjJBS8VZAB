# Customer Service - HappyCustomers
A fast-growing star-tup in the logistics and delivery domain wants to predict what makes their customers happy or unhappy, so they can then take necessary actions.

The company provides us with a small dataset coming from 6 questions they asked their customers. Getting feedback from customers is not easy either. Thus, the company is also interested in finding out whether they need to ask all 6 questions or there are some they can omit.
