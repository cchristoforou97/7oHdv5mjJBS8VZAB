# Customer Service - HappyCustomers
A fast growing startup in the logistics and delivery domain wants to predict what makes their customers happy or unhappy, so they can then take necessary actions.

The company provides us with a small dataset coming from 6 questions they asked their costumers. Getting feedback from customers is not easy either. Thus, the company is also interested in finding out whether they need to ask all 6 questions or there are some they can omit.
